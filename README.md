# RL-in-Reusable-Energy-Utilization

Project Objective - The goal is to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) based agent for 
prosumers and consumers, to minimize the overall energy cost and 
increase the renewable energy utilization. The solution will help control 
the flexible load and optimize the charging and discharging schedule of 
energy storage. The prosumer will get recommendations on when to 
store, consume and offload the energy.
